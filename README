 This application will just read a twitter user's last tweet, check if it is new 
and then tweet it out again...but with a twist, it will change some of the words
in the tweet.

The example project takes Donand Trump tweets and changes words to make it more 
interesting. Also adds some bits to the end of the tweets if space allows.

The token's should be added to the TwitterService.java file before it can read
or tweet.
